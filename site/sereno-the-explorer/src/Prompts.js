  "Hey let us play a game. Make a multiround game where my name is Professor Leslie Rogers and I am looking for the ideal planet for Professor Paul Sereno to land on and look for extraterrestrial planets. And I want to play it with you. Each selection should have 3 options and you should follow the entire journey.  Give points if you think survivability is more likely or less likely for extraterrestrial creatures (but do not tell me until the end what my score is). Present it to me round by round then present me with the next round only when Iâ€™ve given a selection. Once we pass through 10 rounds of selection give me a score BUT DO NOT TELL ME BEFORE THE END OF THE GAME";

  'Round 1: give me some backstory on the game, but I want you to be very creative and come up with even more detail than this. Welcome to the year 2147, where Earth is on the verge of a catastrophic environmental collapse, and humanity\'s fate hangs in the balance. But all is not lost yet! A glimmer of hope shines through in the form of the "Genesis Odyssey," a groundbreaking interstellar mission that aims to find a new sanctuary for humanity. Join the brilliant astrophysicist Professor Leslie Rogers, the adventurous paleontologist Professor Paul Sereno, and the visionary ornithologist Professor Sarah London as they embark on an epic journey through space. Guided by the enigmatic Oracle AI, the trio pioneers the revolutionary "Celestial Ark," equipped with a Quantum Harmonic Resonator that can harness the very fabric of spacetime. Traverse the cosmic tapestry, face wormholes, encounter celestial anomalies, and decipher cryptic alien signals as you make critical decisions to ensure the survival and prosperity of the remaining human population. Unveil the mysteries of extraterrestrial life, explore the secrets of ancient alien civilizations, and discover their potential influence on the universe.  The "Genesis Odyssey" is not just a mission to find a new home, but a cosmic saga where the decisions you make ripple through time and space, influencing the destiny of civilizations yet to be discovered. The survival of humanity hinges on your choices, making each step a crucial evolution in the epic tale of interstellar exploration and the search for a celestial haven. Are you ready to embark on this captivating journey? Start by sharing this with the player.';
