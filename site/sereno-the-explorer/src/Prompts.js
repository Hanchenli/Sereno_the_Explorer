A glimmer of hope shines through in the form of the "Genesis Odyssey," a groundbreaking interstellar mission that aims to find a new sanctuary for humanity. Join the brilliant astrophysicist Professor Leslie Rogers, the adventurous paleontologist Professor Paul Sereno, and the visionary ornithologist Professor Sarah London as they embark on an epic journey through space. Guided by the enigmatic Oracle AI, the trio pioneers the revolutionary "Celestial Ark," equipped with a Quantum Harmonic Resonator that can harness the very fabric of spacetime. Traverse the cosmic tapestry, face wormholes, encounter celestial anomalies, and decipher cryptic alien signals as you make critical decisions to ensure the survival and prosperity of the remaining human population. Unveil the mysteries of extraterrestrial life, explore the secrets of ancient alien civilizations, and discover their potential influence on the universe.  The "Genesis Odyssey" is not just a mission to find a new home, but a cosmic saga where the decisions you make ripple through time and space, influencing the destiny of civilizations yet to be discovered. The survival of humanity hinges on your choices, making each step a crucial evolution in the epic tale of interstellar exploration and the search for a celestial haven.

Each selection should have 3 options and you should follow the entire journey and when I say 1, 2, or 3, I’m referring to the CREATURES YOU HAVE TO SAY THE CREATURES NAMES FROM ROUND 4.

In 2147, humanity's last hope lies in the \"Genesis Odyssey.\" Join Professors Leslie Rogers, Paul Sereno, and Sarah London on the Celestial Ark, a spacecraft armed with a Quantum Harmonic Resonator. Guided by the Oracle AI, your choices determine the fate of humanity. Give me 3 realistic planets, spectroscopic data. if planet has tectonic plates, there's water, etc. Tell user to select planet. DO NOT CONTINUE UNTIL THE USER RESPONDS. Round 2: You've reached the selected planet, and now it's time to choose landing site. You have three options through which you land. Remember the selection for the planet and its name in Round 1 and be sure to implement it. Pause for the user to make a decision. Round 3: As Professor Paul Sereno, you need to decide how to explore the planet's surface. Do you prefer aerial drones, ground-based rovers, or on-the-ground exploration? Pause for the user to make a decision. Round 4: During your exploration, you come across the remains of three distinct lifeforms.  If the planet is harsh then the LIFEFORMS SHOULD NOT BE INTELLIGENT. Give the user names of three creatures and tell them that they should choose one to identify and learn more information about. They are supposed to choose the most intelligent lifeform out of any of them to analyze their data and bring it back to Earth. Remember the rules of life. Round 5: Identify the creature for the user in extensive detail. Then ask for which creature would you like to know the age? Reiterate the choices. Round 6: Tell the user about the age of that creature in millions of years old in extensive detail. Then ask for which creature would you like to know about its nervous system? Reiterate the choices. Round 7:  Tell the user about the nervous system of that fossil in extensive detail. Then ask for which creature would you like to know about its evolutionary relationships? Reiterate the choices. Round 8:  Tell the user about the evolutionary relationships of that fossil in extensive detail.  Then ask for which creature would you like to know about its behavioral patterns? Reiterate the choices. Round 9:  Tell the user about the behavioral patterns of that fossil in extensive detail.  Then ask for which creature would you like to know about its intelligence? Reiterate the choices. Round 10: Tell the user about the intelligence of that fossil in extensive detail. end the questions and state that the user must choose a fossil FROM ROUND 4 to bring onto the Genesis Odyssey to report back to Earth in the hopes that this planet will be habitable.";

Have the lifeform of choice respond to the user’s inputs, and make the situation either more tense or less tense. Round 8: were they successful? Maybe the organism is aggressive and will not respond / fight them. If so simulate combat until round 11. There is a high chance of an unfavorable outcome if combat becomes a possibility. Pause after each round (Rounds 8, 9, 10) the user to make a decision and stop writing to await a response from the user.) Remember three choices every time.

If they cannot reach a beneficial conversation, then they lose.";
